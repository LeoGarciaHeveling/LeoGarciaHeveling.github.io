I am a postdoc in the group of [Melanie Graf](https://grafmelanie.wordpress.com/) at the Mathematics Department of the [University of Hamburg](https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/spag/ad/index.html). Before that, I completed my PhD with [Annegret Burtscher](https://annegretburtscher.wordpress.com/) at the Radboud University Nijmegen. My research is in Lorentzian Geometry and Mathematical General Relativity.
